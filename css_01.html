        <dt>Kadamba Dynasty</dt>
        <dd>The Kadambas (345–540 CE) were an ancient royal family of Karnataka, India,
            that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada 
            district. The kingdom was founded by Mayurasharma in c. 345,
            and at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions.
            An indication of their imperial ambitions is provided by the titles and epithets
            assumed by its rulers, and the marital relations they kept with other kingdoms and empires,
            such as the Vakatakas and Guptas of northern India.
            Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchi possibly with the help of
            some native tribes and claimed sovereignty.
            The Kadamba power reached its peak during the rule of Kakusthavarma.</dd>
